### Before we start...

Head to the <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/developers">Developer Dashboard</a>, fill out an application, and wait less than 24 hours for a response.
Once approved create an API key and make sure you have enough <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/express">models</a> or <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/billing">credits</a>
to use the API.

### Training Models

Once you've purchased models, fetch them using the [get models](/api/get-models) endpoint.
Select the *model id* you'd like to use and pass it to the [train model](/api/train-model) endpoint.

## API Key

After you generate and safely store your API Key, you have to set the `x-tryiton-key` request header to the value of the API Key in all the requests that you send to our public API.

<Info>Your API Key is an authentication key for your specific account, so the models and credits used through the public API are the same ones that you can use via your account.</Info>
