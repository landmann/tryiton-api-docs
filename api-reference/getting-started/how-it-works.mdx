Broadly speaking, this is the flow for getting the most out of these APIs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create API Key">
    Head to the <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/developers">Developer Dashboard</a> and create an API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Credits">
    Purchase <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/express">models</a> or 
    <a href="https://studio.tryitonai.com/billing">credits</a>
    if you don't have any.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train a model">
    Have your users gather 10-30 selfies and train a model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Images">
    An Express model will automatically generate 100-200 images.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Images">
    Use any of the AI edit tools to alter the images to perfection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Key

After you generate and safely store your API Key, you have to set the `x-tryiton-key` request header to the value of the API Key in all the requests that you send to our public API.

<Info>Your API Key is an authentication key for your specific account, so the models and credits used through the public API are the same ones that you can use via your account.</Info>
