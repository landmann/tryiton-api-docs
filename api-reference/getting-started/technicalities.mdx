## Usage and Billing

To prevent abuse, you'll have to pre-purchase models and credits. If you'd like to run some tests, 
you can always use the 50 free credits you get when you create an account.
We can also help you automatically top your account when you run out of credits 
so that your application continues to run smoothly.

Our bulk pricing is the same as the pricing teams get:

- 10% for 50+ models
- 15% for 100+ models
- 20% for 500+ models
- 25% for 1000+ models

## Latency
