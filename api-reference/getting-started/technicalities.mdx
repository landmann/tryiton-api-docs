## Usage and Billing

To prevent abuse, you'll have to pre-purchase models and credits. If you'd like to run some tests, 
you can always use the 50 free credits you get when you create an account.
We can also help you automatically top your account when you run out of credits 
so that your application continues to run smoothly.

Our bulk pricing is the same as the pricing teams get, but extended to all of our products:

- 10% for purchases over \$1,050 and under \$2,100
- 15% for purchases over \$2,100 and under \$10,500
- 20% for purchases over \$10,500 and under \$21,000
- 25% for purchases over \$21,000

## Data Management

#### Models
The fine-tuned models are deleted right after the images are generated 
so you will not be able to generate more images.

#### Images - Uploaded, Generated, and Edited
Neither the input images nor any images generated by us are ever deleted automatically.
You can, however, delete any of them using our API endpoints.

#### Your usage data

We'll also never delete your usage data, or any other metadata, automatically.

Please contanct us if you'd like to schedule a deletion of your **all your data**.

all data associated with that model will be deleted as well, including the images. Therefore, make sure you
download any images you want to keep before deleting a model. */}

## Latency

Training a model takes about 25-45 minutes depending on traffic. AI edits take anywhere up to 90 seconds.
