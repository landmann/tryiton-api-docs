### The Art of Machine Talk

There are two core parameters that dictate user satisfaction: image inputs and prompt inputs.

Uploading input images is a universal concept. Blurriness is perceptible to all. However, 
good prompt inputs are a bit more nuanced as they require a knowing a bit of machine talk.

One of Try it on's core operating philosophies is to design tools that reduce as much guesswork as possible.
`Recreate`, however, does require a human to describe what they want to see.  So, if you decide to implement
`recreate`, make sure to educate your audience so they have the best experience possible.

###  Prompting Recreate

The cardinal rule with recreate is to say exactly what you want to see generated.
Users tend to prompt much more than that. They may use words like `please`, `change`, or `keep`. 
Those words don't help the AI understand what you want to see, and may even confuse it into generating
something you don't want.

<Card>
❌ Don't
* "please change the background to a forest"
* "keep the wall but change the color to green"
* "different background"
<br />
✅ Do's
* "outdoors"
* "in a forest"
* "green background"
</Card>

<Tip>
    Many people will treat the prompt as an instruction to a person. 
    
    Instead, one must treat the prompt is part of a sentence that describes the image.

### Ok, but why?

For the intellectually curious: why is the above true?  When image generation models 
were trained, they were trained using the Alt-text of images on the internet. So, in a way, 
this alt-text is the language that image generation models use to understand the world.
