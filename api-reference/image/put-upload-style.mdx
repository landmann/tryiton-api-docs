### These are styles to be used for the model training

Make sure to retrieve the key, which will be useful in case you want to use your own style when generating headshots.
Do note that small details won't be maintained, so if you include LOGOS or TEXT, they may ruin the final headshot.
Also, don't include hands... it's a hit or miss, so might as well avoid them.
